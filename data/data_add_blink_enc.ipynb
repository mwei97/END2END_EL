MAHALA , Bosnia 1996-08-31 NATO said it was closely monitoring the movement of about 75 Moslem men towards the village of Mahala in Bosnia \\'s Serb republic on Saturday , two days after a violent confrontation with Serbs . \" I have to report this morning that we have in fact received reports ... that up to 75 Moslem men are believed to be approaching Mahala , \" NATO spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Max Marriner said in Sarajevo . Marriner said that NATO troops had set up a checkpoint on the road between Tuzla and Mahala to establish the identities and intentions of the men headed towards the village . Mahala is a Moslem village on Bosnian Serb republic territory . Moslems were driven from the village during the 43- month Bosnian war and most of their houses were destroyed . Some Moslems began returning to rebuild their properties earlier in the week . Fights and shooting broke out between the Moslems and Serb police on Thursday and NATO troops finally brought restored order . A Reuters reporter who entered Mahala on Saturday morning found it tranquil but NATO troops and U.N. police were seen on the ground and NATO helicopters flew overhead .',\n",
